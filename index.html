                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Pens</h2>
                <p class="center">A pen is a common writing instrument that applies ink to a surface, usually paper, for
                    writing or drawing.Early pens such as reed pens, quill pens, dip pens and ruling pens held a small
                    amount of ink on a nib or in a small void or cavity which had to be periodically recharged by
                    dipping the tip of the pen into an inkwell.Today, such pens find only a small number of specialized
                    uses, such as in illustration and calligraphy. Reed pens, quill pens and dip pens, which were used
                    for writing, have been replaced by ballpoint pens, rollerball pens, fountain pens and felt or
                    ceramic tip pens.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Notebooks</h2>
                <p class="center">A notebook (also known as a notepad, writing pad, drawing pad, or legal pad) is a book
                    or stack of paper pages that are often ruled and used for purposes such as note-taking, journaling
                    or other writing, drawing, or scrapbooking.During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, notebooks
                    were often made by hand at home by drawing on them into gatherings that were then bound at a later
                    date. The pages were blank and every notekeeper had to make ruled lines across the paper.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Geometry tools</h2>
                <p class="center">Geometric tools are the instruments used to draw different types of geometric shapes.
                    In Maths, geometry is the most crucial topic, where we learn about the shapes of objects.You are
                    already aware of a couple of them such as triangles, squares, hexagons, circles, parallelograms and
                    so on. Different figures have characteristic properties such as length, breadth, diameter, etc.
                    which set them apart from one another and are parameters to produce the figures on paper.</p>
